A KOAN
A MAN DECIDED TO GO AND STUDY WITH A MASTER 
HE WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE MASTER 
WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE ASKED THE MASTER 
THE STUDENT TOLD THE MASTER HIS NAME 
THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE THAT IS ONLY WHAT YOU ARE CALLED 
WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE HE ASKED AGAIN 
THE MAN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND REPLIED I AM A PROFESSOR 
THAT IS WHAT YOU DO NOT WHAT YOU ARE REPLIED THE MASTER 
WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE 
CONFUSED THE MAN THOUGHT SOME MORE 
FINALLY HE ANSWERED I AM A HUMAN BEING 
THAT IS ONLY YOUR SPECIES NOT WHO YOU ARE 
WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE ASKED THE MASTER AGAIN 
AFTER A MOMENT OF THOUGHT THE PROFESSOR REPLIED 
I AM A CONSCIOUSNESS INHABITING AN ARBITRARY BODY 
THAT IS MERELY WHAT YOU ARE NOT WHO YOU ARE 
WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE 
THE MAN WAS GETTING IRRITATED 
I AM HE STARTED BUT HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY SO HE TRAILED OFF 
AFTER A LONG PAUSE THE MASTER REPLIED THEN YOU ARE WELCOME TO COME STUDY 
AN INSTRUCTION 
DO FOUR UNREASONABLE THINGS EACH DAY 
TO BELIEVE TRUTH IS TO DESTROY POSSIBILITY 
THE LOSS OF DIVINITY 
THE CIRCU MFERENCE PRACTICES THREE BEHAVIORS WHICH CAUSE THE LOSS OF DIVINITY 
CONSUMPTION 
WE CONSUME TOO MUCH BECAUSE WE BELEIVE THE FOLLWING TWO ERRORS WITHIN THE DECEPTION 
WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OR THERE IS NOT ENOUGH 
WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE N OW BY LUCK AND WE WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH LATER TO OBTAIN WHAT WE NEED 
MOST THINGS ARE NOT WORTH CONSUMING 
PRESERVATION 
WE PRESERVE THINGS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WE ARE WEAK 
IF WE LOSE THEM WE WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO GAIN THEM AGAIN 
THIS IS THE DECEPTION 
MOST THINGS ARE NOT WORTH PRESERVING 
ADHERENCE 
WE FOLLOW DOGMA SO THAT WE CAN BELONG AND BE RIGHT 
OR WE FOLLOW REASON SO WE CAN BELONG AND BE RIGHT 
THERE IS NOTHING TO BE RIGHT ABOUT 
TO BELONG IS DEATH 
IT IS THE BEHAVIORS OF CONSUMPTION PRESERVATION AND ADHERENCE THAT HAVE US LOSE OUR PRIMALITY AND THUS OUR DIVINITY 
SOME WISDOM 
AMASS GREAT WEALTH 
NEVER BECOME ATTACHED TO WHAT YOU OWN 
BE PREPARED TO DESTROY ALL THAT YOU OWN 
AN INSTRUCTION 
PROGRAM YOUR MIND 
PROGRAM REALITY 
A KOAN 
DURING A LESSION THE MASTER EXPLAINED THE I 
THE I IS THE VOICE OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE HE SAID 
WHEN ASKED BY A STUDENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANT THE MASTER SAID 
IT IS A VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD 
I DON'T HAVE A VOICE IN MY HEAD THOUGHT THE STUDENT AND HE RAISED HIS HAND TO TELL THE MASTER 
THE MASTER STOPPED THE STUDENT AND SAID THE VOICE THAT JUST SAID YOU HAVE NO VOICE IN YOUR HEAD IS THE I AND THE STUDENTS WERE ENLLIGHTENED 
AN INSTRUCTION 
QUESTION ALL THINGS 
DISCOVER TRUTH INSIDE YOURSELF 
FOLLOW YOUR TRUTH 
IMPOSE NOTHING ON OTHERS
